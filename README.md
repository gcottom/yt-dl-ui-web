This is the web build of the yt-dl-ui. yt-dl-ui is a GUI for downloading audio from YouTube. Uses Spotify api and musicbrainz api for metadata acquisition. This build depends on a microservice to handle the actual retrieval and conversion of the source files as well as setting the metadata for the downloaded files. The microservice is available in my yt-dl-ui-ms repo. This is a proof of concept, showing that Fyne can be used in combination with a microservice to create a functional web application. Additionally extends the functionality of Fyne web build to allow downloading of files to the local machine from the browser.
